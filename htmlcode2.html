    <h1>A Few Poems by Ogden Nash</h1>
    <br>

    <h2>The Panther</h2>
    <p>The panther is like a leopard,<br>
    Except it hasn't been peppered.<br>
    Should you behold a panther crouch,<br>
    Prepare to say Ouch.<br>
    Better yet, if called by a panther,<br>
    Don't anther
    </p>

    <br>


    <h2>Lines on Facing Forty</h2>


 
    <p>I have a bone to pick with fate,<br>
    Come here and tell me girly,<br>
    Do you think my mind is maturing late,<br>
    Or simply rotting early.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>The Lama</h2>

    <p>


     The one-l lama,<br>
    He's a priest. <br> 
    The two-l llama,<br>
    He's a beast.<br>
    And I will bet<br>
    A silk pajama<br>
    There isn't any<br>
    Three-l lllama.


    </p>
